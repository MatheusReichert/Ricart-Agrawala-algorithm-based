# Java P2P Resource Coordination with Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm

## Overview

This Java project implements a peer-to-peer (P2P) system with the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm for resource coordination. It allows multiple Java nodes to coordinate access to two shared resources in a distributed environment. The communication between nodes is achieved using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation), and the project is built and managed using Apache Maven.

## Features

- **Resource Coordination:** The project manages access to two shared resources using the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm, ensuring mutual exclusion.
- **Peer-to-Peer:** Nodes communicate with each other in a decentralized P2P network.
- **Java RMI:** RMI facilitates communication between nodes and resource coordination.
- **Maven:** The project is built and managed using Apache Maven for easy dependency management and building.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Apache Maven installed on your machine.
